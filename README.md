## Number guessing game
A command line number guessing game that allows you to pick a range of guesses and tracks your total attempt number<br>
The program tells you whether your guess was lower or higher than the actual number<br><br>

This code helped me practice while loops (as well as a do-while loop), basic conditional statements and the 'random' library

## Banking Simulator
A simple command line based banking simulator, allowing to deposit or withdraw money (if the balance is sufficient) <br>
The program tracks the total balance within it's run, which can be displayed according to user input <br>
It also verifies the input is valid<br><br>

This code helped me practice the use of static methods, using a 'switch -> case' statement to call them according to user input

## Slot Machine
A command line base slot machine game that uses an arry of emojis and randomizes the result<br>
The program allows the user to bet money from his balance on the slot machine, rewarding him in case of matching symbols (rewards vary per outcome)<br>
The user can control the amount of money he bets and can keep playing until he runs out of money or chooses to stop<br><br>

When writing this code I practiced the usage and editing of string arrays.
