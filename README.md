## Number guessing game
A command line number guessing game that allows you to pick a range of guesses and tracks your total attempt number<br>
The program tells you whether your guess was lower or higher than the actual number<br><br>

This code helped me practice while loops (as well as a do-while loop), basic conditional statements and the 'random' library

## Banking Simulator
A simple command line based banking simulator, allowing to deposit or withdraw money (if the balance is sufficient) <br>
The program tracks the total balance within it's run, which can be displayed according to user input <br>
It also verifies the input is valid<br><br>

This code helped me practice the use of static methods, using a 'switch -> case' statement to call them according to user input
